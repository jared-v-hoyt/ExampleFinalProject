# FinalProjectSetup

This repository contains all of the necessary steps to kickstart the CSCE-361 (Software Engineering) final project given at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and is divided into three distinct sections. I recommend completing the sections in the following order:

1. Database
2. API
3. Frontend

as the API depends on the database, and the frontend depends on the API.

The database and API sections have two different explanation each; the first for users who want to exclusively work in a Windows-only environment and the second for Mac and Linux users or for Windows users who do not want to exclusively work in a Windows-only environment. It is separated this way because many of the tools that we will be using (SQL Server, C#, .NET, etc.) are Microsoft products and work *very* well on the Windows OS.

If you are unsure of which path to pick, the following graph depicts a 2023 survey of the percentage of people that work (not exclusively) in various IDEs:

I try to be as in depth as I can be when explaining each section, but will ultimatly be unable to describe every little nuance. If you're unsure on a section, please reach out to the TAs and we can try to help you understand it.

If there are any issues with any of the sections, please feel free to open a new issue and describe the problem you are having.

It takes approximately 1 to 2 hours to complete all three sections (given that you have all of the necessary tools already installed).
